Anto ---> sends me a message
  Message needs to Render
    Render attaches message to the dom
      if (message was sent by a friend)
        It should look different


Luke ---> waits for the message
  since message has the .friend class
    message appears with .friend styling


---- To differentiate friend or foe?

  assuming friends list is an obj
    if (app.friends[msg.username])
      then they are a friend
        append .friend to message?
